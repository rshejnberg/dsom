				Live Well asked me to come in and make them a site which they could use to store and show their apartment listings. This site includes a secure password-protected database which is accessible after the agents create a username and password for themselves. After having access any of the agents can upload new apartments and modify any of the existing ones on the site. This is all done via a smooth user-friendly interface compatible on mobile devices and phones. </p>
